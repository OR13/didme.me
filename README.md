## Welcome to DID MEME

View the Source Code on [GitHub](https://github.com/OR13/didme.me).

Read the Documentation on [GitHub](https://or13.github.io/didme.me/).

Open the [Web App](https://didme.me).

### Using GitHub Pages

You should review [About GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages).

Using Pages, you can convert a `did:meme` to a `did:web`.

You should beware that unlike `did:meme`, your public `did:web` identifier will be bound to your `github` username.

This means your actions will effect your reputation, and you should avoid embaressing yourself.

You should also review the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

#### Don't publish content that gets you banned.

If someone objects to one of your memes, remove it from GitHub, if you are worried about censorship, consider using a more decentralized platform.

### Using GitHub Actions

You should review [Understanding GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).

There are many actions you might find useful, here is a short list to start with.

- [actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)
- [git-auto-commit-action](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action)
- [verifiable-actions](https://github.com/transmute-industries/verifiable-actions)

### Using MetaMask

See the section on [experimental metamask interop](./metamask.md)

### Review the Method Specification

See the [did:meme method specification](./did-method-spec.md)

### Using Vercel

##### Coming Soon!

The [didme.me](https://didme.me) website is powered by [vercel](https://vercel.com).

In the future, we'll provide documentation on how run your own cloud agent using vercel.

If you are interested in helping write this documentation, we welcome pull requests.

Here is a short list of features that we think a vercel integration will unlock:

- [DIDComm v2](https://didcomm.org/)
- [Multi Lanaguage Service Endpoints for DIDs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/supported-languages)
- [Verifable Credentials API](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api)
